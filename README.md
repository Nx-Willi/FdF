# ðŸ–± 42Paris Project | FdF

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to make a program that will read from a file to represent a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.  
To help us, we'll use the MiniLibX from 42 to discover the basics of graphics programming.  
It does something like this (mine doesn't support colors)  

![FdF Example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8a18f587744f859c298afba0b3362024303dfa5e1ae38713677984440fc5ec0/68747470733a2f2f6e736134302e636173696d616765732e636f6d2f696d672f323031392f30312f31362f3139303131363037343831393438303135352e6a7067 "FdF Example")

## Usage

`make` to compile the program.  
`clean` to clean objects files.  
`fclean` to clean objects files and program file.  
The program work with a file that contains a map that is properly formatted. See **maps/files.fdf** for examples.  

**Execute**: `./fdf <file> <scale>`  
The scale refers to the number of pixels between two points (if not specified an auto-scale is done).
